        <h3 class="h3_title">PROLOGUE</h3>
        <p class="main_text">
            Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
            And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
            Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
            The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3_title">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>

        <p class="phrase">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>

        <h3 class="h3_title">SAMPSON</h3>

        <p class="phrase">Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

        <h3 class="h3_title">GREGORY</h3>

        <p class="phrase">No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
